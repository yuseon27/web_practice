# Template Inheritance

* Advantages of Template Inheritance
    - Code Reusage
    - Consitent UI and Easy to Modify

* Implementation
    1) Make folder named 'templates' in Project folder
    2) Make 'base.html' in 'templates'
    3) Write overlapped codes in 'base.html'
    4) Let 'settings.py' know about 'base.html'

    ```c
        {% extends 'base.html'%}
    ```

        ```c
        from django.urls import include
        ```

        in 'urlpatterns', add 
        ```c
        path('blog/', include('{AppName}.urls')),
